For businesses, cybercrimes can lead to financial loss, operational disruption, data breaches, and a loss of trust, while individuals face identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy invasion.\nRead Cyber Threat Trends Report\nWhat is cybersecurity all about?\nWhat is cybersecurity all about?\nWhy is cybersecurity important?\nTypes of cybersecurity threats\nBest practices for cybersecurity\nWhat is cybersecurity all about?\nCybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These\ncyberattacks\nare usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users through\nransomware\n; or interrupting normal business processes.\nImplementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.\nA successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks.\nPeople\nUsers must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing up data. Learn more about basic cybersecurity principles from these\nTop 10 Cyber Tips\u00a0(PDF)\n.\nProcesses\nOrganizations must have a framework for how they deal with both attempted and successful cyberattacks. One well-respected model, the\nNIST cybersecurity framework\n, can guide you. It explains how you can identify attacks, protect systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover from successful attacks.\nTechnology\nTechnology is essential to giving organizations and individuals the computer security tools needed to protect themselves from cyberattacks. Three main entities must be protected: endpoint devices like computers, smart devices, and routers; networks; and the cloud. Common technology used to protect these entities include\nnext-generation firewalls\n,\nDomain Name System (DNS) filtering\n,\nmalware protection\n, antivirus software, and\nemail security solutions\n.\nWhy is cybersecurity important?\nIn today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced\ncybersecurity solutions\n. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.\nEveryone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of 250 threat researchers at Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyberattack strategies. They reveal new vulnerabilities, educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity, and strengthen open-source tools. Their work makes the internet safer for everyone.\n01:24\nCisco Security: A better way of doing security\nWatch now (01:24)\nTypes of cybersecurity threats\nCloud security\nCloud security\nprovides rapid threat detection and remediation, enhancing visibility and intelligence to prevent malware impacts. It delivers robust protection in multicloud environments, streamlining security without affecting user productivity, and is essential for the safety of applications, data, and users in both hybrid and remote work settings. The scalable nature of cloud security allows for the defense of an expanding array of users, devices, and cloud applications, ensuring comprehensive coverage across all points of potential attack.\nCisco Cloud Protection Suite\n|\nCisco Multicloud Defense\n|\nCisco Cloud Application Security\nIdentity\nIdentity security\nand\naccess management\ninvolve safeguarding the digital identities of individuals, devices, and organizations. This involves implementing security processes, tools, and policies that control user access to accounts and enable productivity with frictionless access to important information without risk.\nThe three main goals of identity security are to:\nAuthenticate a user's identity\nAuthorize access to appropriate resources\nMonitor access activity for weak posture and suspicious activity\nDiscover more about Cisco Identity Intelligence\n|\nDiscover more about Continuous Identity Security\nMalware\nMalware\nis a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer.\nDiscover more about malware protection\n|\nSecure Endpoint\n|\nSecure Endpoint free trial\nPhishing\nPhishing\nis the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and login information, and is the most common type of cyberattack. You can help protect yourself through education or a technology solution that filters malicious emails.\nSecure Email solution\n|\nSecure Email free trial\nRansomware\nRansomware\nis a type of malicious software that is designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored.\nStop ransomware in its tracks\nSocial engineering\nSocial engineering\nis a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Attackers can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data. Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats mentioned above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source.\nRead more about social engineering tactics\nThreat detection\nAn effective extended detection and response (XDR) system integrates solutions across the security stack, making it easier for analysts to focus on comprehensive threat detection, prioritize incident response, and improve productivity. With more visibility and context into data security threats, events that would not have been addressed before will surface to a higher level of awareness, thus allowing cybersecurity teams to quickly eliminate any further impact and reduce the severity and scope of the attack.\nRead more about XDR\n|\nCisco XDR\nZero trust\nZero trust\nisn't a single product or technology. It's a security strategy that is best implemented by keeping an organization's business operations, risks, and security outcomes in mind. Although there are various paths to achieving zero trust maturity, most organizations prioritize deployment of technologies such as multi-factor authentication (MFA),\ndevice posture checks\n,\nzero trust network access (ZTNA)\n, and network segmentation as they implement zero-trust security.\nRead more about zero-trust networking\n|\nCisco Duo\n|\nCisco Secure Access\nBest practices for cybersecurity\nAdopting best practices for cybersecurity can significantly reduce the risk of cyberattacks.\nHere are three key practices:\nRegular software and operating system updates\nUpdating software and operating systems regularly helps to patch vulnerabilities and enhance security measures against potential threats.\nUsing strong and unique passwords\nCreating strong and unique passwords for each online account can enhance cybersecurity, as cyberattacks often exploit weak or stolen passwords.\nImplementing multi-factor authentication (MFA)\nMulti-factor authentication involves multiple identification forms before account access, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\nCisco Duo includes MFA\nthat can integrate with most major applications as well as custom apps.\nFollowing these practices enhances cybersecurity and protects digital assets. It's vital to stay vigilant and informed about the latest threats and security measures to stay ahead of cybercriminals.\nRelated security topics\nWhat is XDR?\nExtended detection and response (XDR) delivers visibility to remediate security threats.\nLearn about XDR\nWhat is a firewall?\nA firewall decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on security rules.\nLearn about firewalls\nWhat is network security?\nNetwork security is a suite of security technologies that protect a network and data.\nLearn about network security\nWhat is endpoint security?\nEndpoint security solutions defend endpoints like mobile devices, computers, and IoT devices.\nLearn about endpoint security\nWhat is DNSSEC?\nA Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC) can help to verify and protect against DNS attacks.\nLearn about DNSSEC\nWhat is cyber resilience?\nCyber resilience is a strategy for stopping breaches, mitigating risk, and improving recovery time.\nLearn about cyber resilience\nReduce complexity to improve protection\nSee how Cisco can revolutionize your security strategy.\nRead e-book\n01:24\nHello, how can I help?\nBy continuing to use our website, you acknowledge the use of cookies.\nPrivacy Statement\nChange Settings\nConsent Manager\nYour opt out preference signal is honored.\nYour Privacy\nStrictly Necessary Cookies\nPerformance Cookies\nTargeting Cookies\nFunctional Cookies\nSocial Media Cookies\nYour Privacy\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that \u201cemployment of information security analysts is projected to grow 32% from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.\u201d\n2\nStrengthen your security intelligence\nStay ahead of threats with news and insights on security, AI and more, weekly in the Think Newsletter.\nSubscribe today\nWhy cybersecurity is important\nCybersecurity is important because cyberattacks and cybercrime have the power to disrupt, damage or destroy businesses, communities and lives. Successful cyberattacks lead to identity theft, personal and corporate extortion, loss of sensitive information and business-critical data, temporary business outages, lost business and lost customers and, in some cases, business closures.\nCyberattacks have an enormous and growing impact on businesses and the economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.\n3\nThe cost of cyberattacks continues to rise as cybercriminals become more sophisticated.\nAccording to IBM's latest\nCost of a Data Breach Report\n:\nThe average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4.88 million from USD 4.45 million in 2023\u2014a 10% spike and the highest increase since the pandemic.\nBusiness losses (revenue loss due to system downtime, lost customers and reputational damage) and post-breach response costs (costs to set up call centers and credit monitoring services for affected customers or to pay regulatory fines), rose nearly 11% over the previous year.\nThe number of organizations paying more than USD 50,000 in regulatory fines as a result of a data breach rose 22.7% over the previous year; those paying more than USD 100,000 rose 19.5%.\nMixture of Experts | 7 March, episode 45\nDecoding AI: Weekly News Roundup\nJoin our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.\nWatch the latest podcast episodes\nCybersecurity challenges\nApart from the sheer volume of cyberattacks, one of the biggest challenges for cybersecurity professionals is the ever-evolving nature of the information technology (IT) landscape, and the way threats evolve with it. Many emerging technologies that offer tremendous new advantages for businesses and individuals also present new opportunities for threat actors and cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks. For example:\nThe pervasive adoption of cloud computing\ncan increase network management complexity and raise the risk of cloud misconfigurations, improperly secured APIs and other avenues hackers can exploit.\nMore remote work, hybrid work and\nbring-your-own-device (BYOD)\npolicies\nmean more connections, devices, applications and data for security teams to protect.\nProliferating\nInternet of Things (IoT)\nand connected devices,\nmany of which are unsecured or improperly secured by default, can be easily hijacked by bad actors.\nThe rise of\nartificial intelligence (AI)\n, and of\ngenerative AI\nin particular, presents an entirely new threat landscape that hackers are already exploiting through prompt injection and other techniques. According to recent research from the IBM\u00ae Institute for Business Value,\nonly 24% of generative AI initiatives are secured\n.\nAs the worldwide attack surface expands, the cybersecurity workforce is struggling to keep pace. A World Economic Forum study found that the global cybersecurity worker gap\u2014the gap between cybersecurity workers and jobs that need to be filled\u2014might reach 85 million workers by 2030.\n4\nClosing this skills gap can have an impact. According to the\nCost of a Data Breach 2024 Report\n, organizations suffering from a high-level shortage of security skills saw an average cost per breach of USD 5.74 million, compared to USD 3.98 million for organizations with lower-level skills shortages.\nResource-strained security teams will increasingly turn to security technologies featuring advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to strengthen their cyber defenses and minimize the impact of successful attacks.\nTypes of cybersecurity\nComprehensive cybersecurity strategies protect all of an organization\u2019s IT infrastructure layers against cyberthreats and cybercrime. Some of the most important cybersecurity domains include:\nAI security\nCritical infrastructure security\nNetwork security\nEndpoint security\nApplication security\nCloud security\nInformation security\nMobile security\nAI security\nAI security\nrefers to measures and technology aimed at preventing or mitigating cyberthreats and cyberattacks that target AI applications or systems or that use AI in malicious ways.\nGenerative AI offers threat actors new attack vectors to exploit. Hackers can use malicious prompts to manipulate AI apps, poison data sources to distort AI outputs and even trick AI tools into sharing sensitive information. They can also use (and have already used) generative AI to create malicious code and phishing emails.\nAI security uses specialized\nrisk management frameworks\n\u2014and increasingly, AI-enabled cybersecurity tools\u2014to protect the AI attack surface. According to the\nCost of a Data Breach 2024 Report\n, organizations that deployed AI-enabled security tools and automation extensively for cyberthreat prevention saw a USD 2.2 million lower average cost per breach compared to organizations with no AI deployed.\nCritical infrastructure security\nCritical infrastructure security protects the computer systems, applications, networks, data and digital assets that a society depends on for national security, economic health and public safety.\nIn the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a cybersecurity framework to help IT providers and stakeholders secure critical infrastructure.\n5\nThe US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also provides guidance.\n6\nNetwork security\nNetwork security\nfocuses on preventing unauthorized access to networks and network resources. It also helps ensure that authorized users have secure and reliable access to the resources and assets they need to do their jobs.\nApplication security\nApplication security helps prevent unauthorized access to and use of apps and related data. It also helps identify and mitigate flaws or vulnerabilities in application design. Modern application development methods such as\nDevOps\nand\nDevSecOps\nbuild security and security testing into the development process.\nCloud security\nCloud security\nsecures an organization\u2019s cloud-based services and assets, including applications, data, virtual servers and other infrastructure.\nGenerally speaking, cloud security operates on the shared responsibility model. The cloud provider is responsible for securing the services that they deliver and the infrastructure that delivers them. The customer is responsible for protecting their data, code and other assets they store or run in the cloud.\nInformation security and data security\nInformation security (InfoSec)\nprotects an organization's important information\u2014digital files and data, paper documents, physical media\u2014against unauthorized access, use or alteration.\nData security\n, the protection of digital information, is a subset of information security and the focus of most cybersecurity-related InfoSec measures.\nMobile security\nMobile security\nencompasses cybersecurity tools and practices specific to smartphones and other mobile devices, including mobile application management (MAM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM).\nMore recently, organizations are adopting\nunified endpoint management (UEM)\nsolutions that allow them to protect, configure and manage all endpoint devices, including mobile devices, from a single console.\nCommon cybersecurity threats\nSome of the most common types of cyberthreats include\nMalware\nRansomware\nPhishing\nCredential theft and abuse\nInsider threats\nAI attacks\nCryptojacking\nDistributed denial of service (DDoS)\nMalware\nMalware, short for \"malicious software\", is any software code or computer program that is intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users. Almost every modern\ncyberattack\ninvolves some type of malware.\nHackers and cybercriminals create and use malware to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and sensitive data, hijack computer systems and operate them remotely, disrupt or damage computer systems, or hold data or systems hostage for large sums of money (see \"Ransomware\").\nRansomware\nRansomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim\u2019s data or device and threatens to keep it encrypted\u2014or worse\u2014unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker.\nThe earliest ransomware attacks demanded a ransom in exchange for the encryption key required to unlock the victim\u2019s data. Starting around 2019, almost all ransomware attacks were\ndouble extortion\nattacks that also threatened to publicly share victims\u2019 data; some\ntriple extortion\nattacks added the threat of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\nMore recently, ransomware attacks are on the decline. According to the\nIBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2024\n,\nransomware attacks accounted for 20% of all attacks in 2023, down 11.5% from 2022. The decline is likely the result of improved ransomware prevention, more effective law enforcement intervention and data backup and protection practices that enable businesses to recover without paying the ransom.\nIn the meantime, ransomware attackers have repurposed their resources to start other types of cyberthreats, including\ninfostealer\nmalware that allows attackers to steal data and hold it hostage without locking down the victim\u2019s systems and\ndata destruction\nattacks that destroy or threaten to destroy data for specific purposes.\nPhishing\nPhishing attacks are email, text or voice messages that trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or sending funds to the wrong people.\nMost users are familiar with bulk phishing scams\u2014mass-mailed fraudulent messages that appear to be from a large and trusted brand, asking recipients to reset their passwords or reenter credit card information. More sophisticated phishing scams, such as\nspear phishing\nand\nbusiness email compromise (BEC)\n, target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money.\nPhishing is just one type of\nsocial engineering\n, a class of \u201chuman hacking\u201d tactics and interactive attacks that use psychological manipulation to pressure people into taking unwise actions.\nCredential theft and account abuse\nThe\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\nfound that identity-based attacks, which hijack legitimate user accounts and abuse their privileges, account for 30% of attacks. This makes identity-based attacks the most common entry point into corporate networks.\nHackers have many techniques for stealing credentials and taking over accounts. For example, Kerberoasting attacks manipulate the Kerberos authentication protocol commonly used in Microsoft Active Directory to seize privileged service accounts. In 2023, the\nIBM X-Force team experienced\na 100% increase in Kerberoasting incidents.\nSimilarly, the X-Force team saw a 266% increase in the use of infostealer malware that secretly records user credentials and other sensitive data.\nInsider threats\nInsider threats are threats that originate with authorized users\u2014employees, contractors, business partners\u2014who intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals.\nInsider threats can be harder to detect than external threats because they have the earmarks of authorized activity and are invisible to antivirus software, firewalls and other security solutions that block external attacks.\nAI attacks\nMuch like cybersecurity professionals are using AI to strengthen their defenses, cybercriminals are using AI to conduct advanced attacks.\nIn generative AI fraud, scammers use\ngenerative AI\nto produce fake emails, applications and other business documents to fool people into sharing sensitive data or sending money.\nThe\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\nreports that scammers can use open source generative AI tools to craft convincing phishing emails in as little as five minutes. For comparison, it takes scammers 16 hours to come up with the same message manually.\nHackers are also using organizations\u2019 AI tools as attack vectors. For example, in prompt injection attacks, threat actors use malicious inputs to manipulate generative AI systems into leaking sensitive data, spreading misinformation or worse.\nCryptojacking\nCryptojacking happens when hackers gain access to an endpoint device and secretly use its computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or monero.\nSecurity analysts identified cryptojacking as a cyberthreat around 2011, shortly after the introduction of cryptocurrency. According to the IBM\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\n, cryptojacking is now among the top three areas of operations for cybercriminals.\nDistributed denial of service (DDoS)\nA DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network by overloading it with traffic, usually from a botnet\u2014a network of distributed systems that a cybercriminal hijacks by using malware and remote-controlled operations.\nThe global volume of DDoS attacks spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasingly, attackers are combining DDoS attacks with ransomware attacks, or simply threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless the target pays a ransom.\nCybersecurity myths\nDespite an ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity incidents worldwide and the insights gleaned from resolving these incidents, some misconceptions persist. Some of the most dangerous include:\nStrong passwords are adequate protection\nStrong passwords do make a difference; for example, a 12-character password takes 62 trillion times longer to crack than a 6-character password. But passwords are relatively easy to acquire in other ways, such as through social engineering, keylogging malware, buying them on the dark web or paying disgruntled insiders to steal them.\nMost cybersecurity risks are well-known\nIn fact, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly changing. Thousands of new vulnerabilities are reported in old and new applications and devices every year. Opportunities for human error\u2014specifically by negligent employees or contractors who unintentionally cause a data breach\u2014keep increasing.\nAll cyberattack vectors are contained\nCybercriminals find new attack vectors all the time. The rise of AI technologies, operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud environments all give hackers new opportunities to cause trouble.\nMy industry is safe\nEvery industry has its share of cybersecurity risks. For example, ransomware attacks are targeting more sectors than ever, including local governments, nonprofits and healthcare providers. Attacks on supply chains, \".gov\" websites and critical infrastructure have also increased.\nCybercriminals don\u2019t attack small businesses\nYes, they do. The\nHiscox Cyber Readiness Report\nfound that almost half (41%) of small businesses in the US experienced a cyberattack in the last year.\n7\nKey cybersecurity best practices and technologies\nWhile each organization\u2019s cybersecurity strategy differs, many use these tools and tactics to reduce vulnerabilities, prevent attacks and intercept attacks in progress:\nSecurity awareness training\nData security tools\nIdentity and access management\nThreat detection and response\nDisaster recovery\nSecurity awareness training\nSecurity awareness training helps users understand how seemingly harmless actions\u2014from using the same simple password for multiple log-ins to oversharing on social media\u2014increase their own or their organization\u2019s risk of attack.\nCombined with thought-out\ndata security\npolicies, security awareness training can help employees protect sensitive personal and organizational data. It can also help them recognize and avoid phishing and malware attacks.\nData security tools\nData security tools, such as\nencryption\nand\ndata loss prevention\n(DLP) solutions, can help stop security threats in progress or mitigate their effects. For example, DLP tools can detect and block attempted data theft, while encryption can make it so that any data that hackers steal is useless to them.\nIdentity and access management\nIdentity and access management (IAM)\nrefers to the tools and strategies that control how users access resources and what they can do with those resources.\nIAM technologies can help protect against account theft. For example,\nmultifactor authentication\nrequires users to supply multiple credentials to log in, meaning threat actors need more than just a password to break into an account.\nLikewise, adaptive authentication systems detect when users are engaging in risky behavior and raise additional authentication challenges before allowing them to proceed. Adaptive authentication can help limit the\nlateral movement\nof hackers who make it into the system.\nA\nzero trust\narchitecture is one way to enforce strict access controls by verifying all connection requests between users and devices, applications and data.\nAttack surface management\nAttack surface management (ASM)\nis the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organization\u2019s\nattack surface\n.\nUnlike other cyberdefense disciplines, ASM is conducted entirely from a hacker\u2019s perspective rather than the perspective of the defender. It identifies targets and assesses risks based on the opportunities they present to a malicious attacker.\nThreat detection and response\nAnalytics- and AI-driven technologies can help identify and respond to attacks in progress. These technologies can include\nsecurity information and event management (SIEM)\n,\nsecurity orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)\nand\nendpoint detection and response (EDR)\n. Typically, organizations use these technologies as part of a formal\nincident response\nplan.\nDisaster recovery\nDisaster recovery\ncapabilities can play a key role in maintaining business continuity and remediating threats in the event of a cyberattack. For example, the ability to fail over to a backup that is hosted in a remote location can help a business resume operations after a ransomware attack (sometimes without paying a ransom)\nFootnotes\n1\nTop 10 Cybersecurity Predictions And Statistics For 2024\n,\nCybercrime Magazine,\n5 February 2024.\n2\nState of the Tech Workforce | Cyberstates 2024\n,\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA),\nMarch 2024.\n3\nCybercrime threatens business growth.

More sophisticated phishing scams, such as\nspear phishing\nand\nbusiness email compromise (BEC)\n, target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money.\nPhishing is just one type of\nsocial engineering\n, a class of \u201chuman hacking\u201d tactics and interactive attacks that use psychological manipulation to pressure people into taking unwise actions.\nCredential theft and account abuse\nThe\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\nfound that identity-based attacks, which hijack legitimate user accounts and abuse their privileges, account for 30% of attacks. This makes identity-based attacks the most common entry point into corporate networks.\nHackers have many techniques for stealing credentials and taking over accounts. For example, Kerberoasting attacks manipulate the Kerberos authentication protocol commonly used in Microsoft Active Directory to seize privileged service accounts. In 2023, the\nIBM X-Force team experienced\na 100% increase in Kerberoasting incidents.\nSimilarly, the X-Force team saw a 266% increase in the use of infostealer malware that secretly records user credentials and other sensitive data.\nInsider threats\nInsider threats are threats that originate with authorized users\u2014employees, contractors, business partners\u2014who intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals.\nInsider threats can be harder to detect than external threats because they have the earmarks of authorized activity and are invisible to antivirus software, firewalls and other security solutions that block external attacks.\nAI attacks\nMuch like cybersecurity professionals are using AI to strengthen their defenses, cybercriminals are using AI to conduct advanced attacks.\nIn generative AI fraud, scammers use\ngenerative AI\nto produce fake emails, applications and other business documents to fool people into sharing sensitive data or sending money.\nThe\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\nreports that scammers can use open source generative AI tools to craft convincing phishing emails in as little as five minutes. For comparison, it takes scammers 16 hours to come up with the same message manually.\nHackers are also using organizations\u2019 AI tools as attack vectors. For example, in prompt injection attacks, threat actors use malicious inputs to manipulate generative AI systems into leaking sensitive data, spreading misinformation or worse.\nCryptojacking\nCryptojacking happens when hackers gain access to an endpoint device and secretly use its computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or monero.\nSecurity analysts identified cryptojacking as a cyberthreat around 2011, shortly after the introduction of cryptocurrency. According to the IBM\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\n, cryptojacking is now among the top three areas of operations for cybercriminals.\nDistributed denial of service (DDoS)\nA DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network by overloading it with traffic, usually from a botnet\u2014a network of distributed systems that a cybercriminal hijacks by using malware and remote-controlled operations.\nThe global volume of DDoS attacks spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasingly, attackers are combining DDoS attacks with ransomware attacks, or simply threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless the target pays a ransom.\nCybersecurity myths\nDespite an ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity incidents worldwide and the insights gleaned from resolving these incidents, some misconceptions persist. Some of the most dangerous include:\nStrong passwords are adequate protection\nStrong passwords do make a difference; for example, a 12-character password takes 62 trillion times longer to crack than a 6-character password. But passwords are relatively easy to acquire in other ways, such as through social engineering, keylogging malware, buying them on the dark web or paying disgruntled insiders to steal them.\nMost cybersecurity risks are well-known\nIn fact, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly changing. Thousands of new vulnerabilities are reported in old and new applications and devices every year. Opportunities for human error\u2014specifically by negligent employees or contractors who unintentionally cause a data breach\u2014keep increasing.\nAll cyberattack vectors are contained\nCybercriminals find new attack vectors all the time. The rise of AI technologies, operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud environments all give hackers new opportunities to cause trouble.\nMy industry is safe\nEvery industry has its share of cybersecurity risks. For example, ransomware attacks are targeting more sectors than ever, including local governments, nonprofits and healthcare providers. Attacks on supply chains, \".gov\" websites and critical infrastructure have also increased.\nCybercriminals don\u2019t attack small businesses\nYes, they do. The\nHiscox Cyber Readiness Report\nfound that almost half (41%) of small businesses in the US experienced a cyberattack in the last year.\n7\nKey cybersecurity best practices and technologies\nWhile each organization\u2019s cybersecurity strategy differs, many use these tools and tactics to reduce vulnerabilities, prevent attacks and intercept attacks in progress:\nSecurity awareness training\nData security tools\nIdentity and access management\nThreat detection and response\nDisaster recovery\nSecurity awareness training\nSecurity awareness training helps users understand how seemingly harmless actions\u2014from using the same simple password for multiple log-ins to oversharing on social media\u2014increase their own or their organization\u2019s risk of attack.\nCombined with thought-out\ndata security\npolicies, security awareness training can help employees protect sensitive personal and organizational data. It can also help them recognize and avoid phishing and malware attacks.\nData security tools\nData security tools, such as\nencryption\nand\ndata loss prevention\n(DLP) solutions, can help stop security threats in progress or mitigate their effects. For example, DLP tools can detect and block attempted data theft, while encryption can make it so that any data that hackers steal is useless to them.\nIdentity and access management\nIdentity and access management (IAM)\nrefers to the tools and strategies that control how users access resources and what they can do with those resources.\nIAM technologies can help protect against account theft. For example,\nmultifactor authentication\nrequires users to supply multiple credentials to log in, meaning threat actors need more than just a password to break into an account.\nLikewise, adaptive authentication systems detect when users are engaging in risky behavior and raise additional authentication challenges before allowing them to proceed. Adaptive authentication can help limit the\nlateral movement\nof hackers who make it into the system.\nA\nzero trust\narchitecture is one way to enforce strict access controls by verifying all connection requests between users and devices, applications and data.\nAttack surface management\nAttack surface management (ASM)\nis the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organization\u2019s\nattack surface\n.\nUnlike other cyberdefense disciplines, ASM is conducted entirely from a hacker\u2019s perspective rather than the perspective of the defender. It identifies targets and assesses risks based on the opportunities they present to a malicious attacker.\nThreat detection and response\nAnalytics- and AI-driven technologies can help identify and respond to attacks in progress. These technologies can include\nsecurity information and event management (SIEM)\n,\nsecurity orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)\nand\nendpoint detection and response (EDR)\n. Typically, organizations use these technologies as part of a formal\nincident response\nplan.\nDisaster recovery\nDisaster recovery\ncapabilities can play a key role in maintaining business continuity and remediating threats in the event of a cyberattack. For example, the ability to fail over to a backup that is hosted in a remote location can help a business resume operations after a ransomware attack (sometimes without paying a ransom)\nFootnotes\n1\nTop 10 Cybersecurity Predictions And Statistics For 2024\n,\nCybercrime Magazine,\n5 February 2024.\n2\nState of the Tech Workforce | Cyberstates 2024\n,\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA),\nMarch 2024.\n3\nCybercrime threatens business growth.

Successful cyberattacks lead to identity theft, personal and corporate extortion, loss of sensitive information and business-critical data, temporary business outages, lost business and lost customers and, in some cases, business closures.\nCyberattacks have an enormous and growing impact on businesses and the economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.\n3\nThe cost of cyberattacks continues to rise as cybercriminals become more sophisticated.\nAccording to IBM's latest\nCost of a Data Breach Report\n:\nThe average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4.88 million from USD 4.45 million in 2023\u2014a 10% spike and the highest increase since the pandemic.\nBusiness losses (revenue loss due to system downtime, lost customers and reputational damage) and post-breach response costs (costs to set up call centers and credit monitoring services for affected customers or to pay regulatory fines), rose nearly 11% over the previous year.\nThe number of organizations paying more than USD 50,000 in regulatory fines as a result of a data breach rose 22.7% over the previous year; those paying more than USD 100,000 rose 19.5%.\nMixture of Experts | 7 March, episode 45\nDecoding AI: Weekly News Roundup\nJoin our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.\nWatch the latest podcast episodes\nCybersecurity challenges\nApart from the sheer volume of cyberattacks, one of the biggest challenges for cybersecurity professionals is the ever-evolving nature of the information technology (IT) landscape, and the way threats evolve with it. Many emerging technologies that offer tremendous new advantages for businesses and individuals also present new opportunities for threat actors and cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks. For example:\nThe pervasive adoption of cloud computing\ncan increase network management complexity and raise the risk of cloud misconfigurations, improperly secured APIs and other avenues hackers can exploit.\nMore remote work, hybrid work and\nbring-your-own-device (BYOD)\npolicies\nmean more connections, devices, applications and data for security teams to protect.\nProliferating\nInternet of Things (IoT)\nand connected devices,\nmany of which are unsecured or improperly secured by default, can be easily hijacked by bad actors.\nThe rise of\nartificial intelligence (AI)\n, and of\ngenerative AI\nin particular, presents an entirely new threat landscape that hackers are already exploiting through prompt injection and other techniques. According to recent research from the IBM\u00ae Institute for Business Value,\nonly 24% of generative AI initiatives are secured\n.\nAs the worldwide attack surface expands, the cybersecurity workforce is struggling to keep pace. A World Economic Forum study found that the global cybersecurity worker gap\u2014the gap between cybersecurity workers and jobs that need to be filled\u2014might reach 85 million workers by 2030.\n4\nClosing this skills gap can have an impact. According to the\nCost of a Data Breach 2024 Report\n, organizations suffering from a high-level shortage of security skills saw an average cost per breach of USD 5.74 million, compared to USD 3.98 million for organizations with lower-level skills shortages.\nResource-strained security teams will increasingly turn to security technologies featuring advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to strengthen their cyber defenses and minimize the impact of successful attacks.\nTypes of cybersecurity\nComprehensive cybersecurity strategies protect all of an organization\u2019s IT infrastructure layers against cyberthreats and cybercrime. Some of the most important cybersecurity domains include:\nAI security\nCritical infrastructure security\nNetwork security\nEndpoint security\nApplication security\nCloud security\nInformation security\nMobile security\nAI security\nAI security\nrefers to measures and technology aimed at preventing or mitigating cyberthreats and cyberattacks that target AI applications or systems or that use AI in malicious ways.\nGenerative AI offers threat actors new attack vectors to exploit. Hackers can use malicious prompts to manipulate AI apps, poison data sources to distort AI outputs and even trick AI tools into sharing sensitive information. They can also use (and have already used) generative AI to create malicious code and phishing emails.\nAI security uses specialized\nrisk management frameworks\n\u2014and increasingly, AI-enabled cybersecurity tools\u2014to protect the AI attack surface. According to the\nCost of a Data Breach 2024 Report\n, organizations that deployed AI-enabled security tools and automation extensively for cyberthreat prevention saw a USD 2.2 million lower average cost per breach compared to organizations with no AI deployed.\nCritical infrastructure security\nCritical infrastructure security protects the computer systems, applications, networks, data and digital assets that a society depends on for national security, economic health and public safety.\nIn the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a cybersecurity framework to help IT providers and stakeholders secure critical infrastructure.\n5\nThe US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also provides guidance.\n6\nNetwork security\nNetwork security\nfocuses on preventing unauthorized access to networks and network resources. It also helps ensure that authorized users have secure and reliable access to the resources and assets they need to do their jobs.\nApplication security\nApplication security helps prevent unauthorized access to and use of apps and related data. It also helps identify and mitigate flaws or vulnerabilities in application design. Modern application development methods such as\nDevOps\nand\nDevSecOps\nbuild security and security testing into the development process.\nCloud security\nCloud security\nsecures an organization\u2019s cloud-based services and assets, including applications, data, virtual servers and other infrastructure.\nGenerally speaking, cloud security operates on the shared responsibility model. The cloud provider is responsible for securing the services that they deliver and the infrastructure that delivers them. The customer is responsible for protecting their data, code and other assets they store or run in the cloud.\nInformation security and data security\nInformation security (InfoSec)\nprotects an organization's important information\u2014digital files and data, paper documents, physical media\u2014against unauthorized access, use or alteration.\nData security\n, the protection of digital information, is a subset of information security and the focus of most cybersecurity-related InfoSec measures.\nMobile security\nMobile security\nencompasses cybersecurity tools and practices specific to smartphones and other mobile devices, including mobile application management (MAM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM).\nMore recently, organizations are adopting\nunified endpoint management (UEM)\nsolutions that allow them to protect, configure and manage all endpoint devices, including mobile devices, from a single console.\nCommon cybersecurity threats\nSome of the most common types of cyberthreats include\nMalware\nRansomware\nPhishing\nCredential theft and abuse\nInsider threats\nAI attacks\nCryptojacking\nDistributed denial of service (DDoS)\nMalware\nMalware, short for \"malicious software\", is any software code or computer program that is intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users. Almost every modern\ncyberattack\ninvolves some type of malware.\nHackers and cybercriminals create and use malware to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and sensitive data, hijack computer systems and operate them remotely, disrupt or damage computer systems, or hold data or systems hostage for large sums of money (see \"Ransomware\").\nRansomware\nRansomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim\u2019s data or device and threatens to keep it encrypted\u2014or worse\u2014unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker.\nThe earliest ransomware attacks demanded a ransom in exchange for the encryption key required to unlock the victim\u2019s data. Starting around 2019, almost all ransomware attacks were\ndouble extortion\nattacks that also threatened to publicly share victims\u2019 data; some\ntriple extortion\nattacks added the threat of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\nMore recently, ransomware attacks are on the decline. According to the\nIBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2024\n,\nransomware attacks accounted for 20% of all attacks in 2023, down 11.5% from 2022. The decline is likely the result of improved ransomware prevention, more effective law enforcement intervention and data backup and protection practices that enable businesses to recover without paying the ransom.\nIn the meantime, ransomware attackers have repurposed their resources to start other types of cyberthreats, including\ninfostealer\nmalware that allows attackers to steal data and hold it hostage without locking down the victim\u2019s systems and\ndata destruction\nattacks that destroy or threaten to destroy data for specific purposes.\nPhishing\nPhishing attacks are email, text or voice messages that trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or sending funds to the wrong people.\nMost users are familiar with bulk phishing scams\u2014mass-mailed fraudulent messages that appear to be from a large and trusted brand, asking recipients to reset their passwords or reenter credit card information. More sophisticated phishing scams, such as\nspear phishing\nand\nbusiness email compromise (BEC)\n, target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money.\nPhishing is just one type of\nsocial engineering\n, a class of \u201chuman hacking\u201d tactics and interactive attacks that use psychological manipulation to pressure people into taking unwise actions.\nCredential theft and account abuse\nThe\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\nfound that identity-based attacks, which hijack legitimate user accounts and abuse their privileges, account for 30% of attacks.

It also helps ensure that authorized users have secure and reliable access to the resources and assets they need to do their jobs.\nApplication security\nApplication security helps prevent unauthorized access to and use of apps and related data. It also helps identify and mitigate flaws or vulnerabilities in application design. Modern application development methods such as\nDevOps\nand\nDevSecOps\nbuild security and security testing into the development process.\nCloud security\nCloud security\nsecures an organization\u2019s cloud-based services and assets, including applications, data, virtual servers and other infrastructure.\nGenerally speaking, cloud security operates on the shared responsibility model. The cloud provider is responsible for securing the services that they deliver and the infrastructure that delivers them. The customer is responsible for protecting their data, code and other assets they store or run in the cloud.\nInformation security and data security\nInformation security (InfoSec)\nprotects an organization's important information\u2014digital files and data, paper documents, physical media\u2014against unauthorized access, use or alteration.\nData security\n, the protection of digital information, is a subset of information security and the focus of most cybersecurity-related InfoSec measures.\nMobile security\nMobile security\nencompasses cybersecurity tools and practices specific to smartphones and other mobile devices, including mobile application management (MAM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM).\nMore recently, organizations are adopting\nunified endpoint management (UEM)\nsolutions that allow them to protect, configure and manage all endpoint devices, including mobile devices, from a single console.\nCommon cybersecurity threats\nSome of the most common types of cyberthreats include\nMalware\nRansomware\nPhishing\nCredential theft and abuse\nInsider threats\nAI attacks\nCryptojacking\nDistributed denial of service (DDoS)\nMalware\nMalware, short for \"malicious software\", is any software code or computer program that is intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users. Almost every modern\ncyberattack\ninvolves some type of malware.\nHackers and cybercriminals create and use malware to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and sensitive data, hijack computer systems and operate them remotely, disrupt or damage computer systems, or hold data or systems hostage for large sums of money (see \"Ransomware\").\nRansomware\nRansomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim\u2019s data or device and threatens to keep it encrypted\u2014or worse\u2014unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker.\nThe earliest ransomware attacks demanded a ransom in exchange for the encryption key required to unlock the victim\u2019s data. Starting around 2019, almost all ransomware attacks were\ndouble extortion\nattacks that also threatened to publicly share victims\u2019 data; some\ntriple extortion\nattacks added the threat of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\nMore recently, ransomware attacks are on the decline. According to the\nIBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2024\n,\nransomware attacks accounted for 20% of all attacks in 2023, down 11.5% from 2022. The decline is likely the result of improved ransomware prevention, more effective law enforcement intervention and data backup and protection practices that enable businesses to recover without paying the ransom.\nIn the meantime, ransomware attackers have repurposed their resources to start other types of cyberthreats, including\ninfostealer\nmalware that allows attackers to steal data and hold it hostage without locking down the victim\u2019s systems and\ndata destruction\nattacks that destroy or threaten to destroy data for specific purposes.\nPhishing\nPhishing attacks are email, text or voice messages that trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or sending funds to the wrong people.\nMost users are familiar with bulk phishing scams\u2014mass-mailed fraudulent messages that appear to be from a large and trusted brand, asking recipients to reset their passwords or reenter credit card information. More sophisticated phishing scams, such as\nspear phishing\nand\nbusiness email compromise (BEC)\n, target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money.\nPhishing is just one type of\nsocial engineering\n, a class of \u201chuman hacking\u201d tactics and interactive attacks that use psychological manipulation to pressure people into taking unwise actions.\nCredential theft and account abuse\nThe\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\nfound that identity-based attacks, which hijack legitimate user accounts and abuse their privileges, account for 30% of attacks. This makes identity-based attacks the most common entry point into corporate networks.\nHackers have many techniques for stealing credentials and taking over accounts. For example, Kerberoasting attacks manipulate the Kerberos authentication protocol commonly used in Microsoft Active Directory to seize privileged service accounts. In 2023, the\nIBM X-Force team experienced\na 100% increase in Kerberoasting incidents.\nSimilarly, the X-Force team saw a 266% increase in the use of infostealer malware that secretly records user credentials and other sensitive data.\nInsider threats\nInsider threats are threats that originate with authorized users\u2014employees, contractors, business partners\u2014who intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals.\nInsider threats can be harder to detect than external threats because they have the earmarks of authorized activity and are invisible to antivirus software, firewalls and other security solutions that block external attacks.\nAI attacks\nMuch like cybersecurity professionals are using AI to strengthen their defenses, cybercriminals are using AI to conduct advanced attacks.\nIn generative AI fraud, scammers use\ngenerative AI\nto produce fake emails, applications and other business documents to fool people into sharing sensitive data or sending money.\nThe\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\nreports that scammers can use open source generative AI tools to craft convincing phishing emails in as little as five minutes. For comparison, it takes scammers 16 hours to come up with the same message manually.\nHackers are also using organizations\u2019 AI tools as attack vectors. For example, in prompt injection attacks, threat actors use malicious inputs to manipulate generative AI systems into leaking sensitive data, spreading misinformation or worse.\nCryptojacking\nCryptojacking happens when hackers gain access to an endpoint device and secretly use its computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or monero.\nSecurity analysts identified cryptojacking as a cyberthreat around 2011, shortly after the introduction of cryptocurrency. According to the IBM\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index\n, cryptojacking is now among the top three areas of operations for cybercriminals.\nDistributed denial of service (DDoS)\nA DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network by overloading it with traffic, usually from a botnet\u2014a network of distributed systems that a cybercriminal hijacks by using malware and remote-controlled operations.\nThe global volume of DDoS attacks spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasingly, attackers are combining DDoS attacks with ransomware attacks, or simply threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless the target pays a ransom.\nCybersecurity myths\nDespite an ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity incidents worldwide and the insights gleaned from resolving these incidents, some misconceptions persist. Some of the most dangerous include:\nStrong passwords are adequate protection\nStrong passwords do make a difference; for example, a 12-character password takes 62 trillion times longer to crack than a 6-character password. But passwords are relatively easy to acquire in other ways, such as through social engineering, keylogging malware, buying them on the dark web or paying disgruntled insiders to steal them.\nMost cybersecurity risks are well-known\nIn fact, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly changing. Thousands of new vulnerabilities are reported in old and new applications and devices every year. Opportunities for human error\u2014specifically by negligent employees or contractors who unintentionally cause a data breach\u2014keep increasing.\nAll cyberattack vectors are contained\nCybercriminals find new attack vectors all the time. The rise of AI technologies, operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud environments all give hackers new opportunities to cause trouble.\nMy industry is safe\nEvery industry has its share of cybersecurity risks. For example, ransomware attacks are targeting more sectors than ever, including local governments, nonprofits and healthcare providers. Attacks on supply chains, \".gov\" websites and critical infrastructure have also increased.\nCybercriminals don\u2019t attack small businesses\nYes, they do. The\nHiscox Cyber Readiness Report\nfound that almost half (41%) of small businesses in the US experienced a cyberattack in the last year.\n7\nKey cybersecurity best practices and technologies\nWhile each organization\u2019s cybersecurity strategy differs, many use these tools and tactics to reduce vulnerabilities, prevent attacks and intercept attacks in progress:\nSecurity awareness training\nData security tools\nIdentity and access management\nThreat detection and response\nDisaster recovery\nSecurity awareness training\nSecurity awareness training helps users understand how seemingly harmless actions\u2014from using the same simple password for multiple log-ins to oversharing on social media\u2014increase their own or their organization\u2019s risk of attack.\nCombined with thought-out\ndata security\npolicies, security awareness training can help employees protect sensitive personal and organizational data. It can also help them recognize and avoid phishing and malware attacks.\nData security tools\nData security tools, such as\nencryption\nand\ndata loss prevention\n(DLP) solutions, can help stop security threats in progress or mitigate their effects. For example, DLP tools can detect and block attempted data theft, while encryption can make it so that any data that hackers steal is useless to them.\nIdentity and access management\nIdentity and access management (IAM)\nrefers to the tools and strategies that control how users access resources and what they can do with those resources.\nIAM technologies can help protect against account theft. For example,\nmultifactor authentication\nrequires users to supply multiple credentials to log in, meaning threat actors need more than just a password to break into an account.\nLikewise, adaptive authentication systems detect when users are engaging in risky behavior and raise additional authentication challenges before allowing them to proceed. Adaptive authentication can help limit the\nlateral movement\nof hackers who make it into the system.\nA\nzero trust\narchitecture is one way to enforce strict access controls by verifying all connection requests between users and devices, applications and data.\nAttack surface management\nAttack surface management (ASM)\nis the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organization\u2019s\nattack surface\n.\nUnlike other cyberdefense disciplines, ASM is conducted entirely from a hacker\u2019s perspective rather than the perspective of the defender. It identifies targets and assesses risks based on the opportunities they present to a malicious attacker.\nThreat detection and response\nAnalytics- and AI-driven technologies can help identify and respond to attacks in progress. These technologies can include\nsecurity information and event management (SIEM)\n,\nsecurity orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)\nand\nendpoint detection and response (EDR)\n. Typically, organizations use these technologies as part of a formal\nincident response\nplan.\nDisaster recovery\nDisaster recovery\ncapabilities can play a key role in maintaining business continuity and remediating threats in the event of a cyberattack. For example, the ability to fail over to a backup that is hosted in a remote location can help a business resume operations after a ransomware attack (sometimes without paying a ransom)\nFootnotes\n1\nTop 10 Cybersecurity Predictions And Statistics For 2024\n,\nCybercrime Magazine,\n5 February 2024.\n2\nState of the Tech Workforce | Cyberstates 2024\n,\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA),\nMarch 2024.\n3\nCybercrime threatens business growth.
